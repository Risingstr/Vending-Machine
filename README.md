# Vending-Machine
This project involves designing a basic vending machine using Verilog. The machine sells an item priced at 15 units and accepts coins of 5 and 10 units. The goal is to create a system that accurately processes the coins and dispenses the item when the total amount reaches or exceeds 15 units.
